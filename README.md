Python package for molecular structure and Gromacs topology manipulation

## License

You can use Dorothy under the terms of the MIT License; see
[`LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/ofisette/mdjoy/blob/master/LICENSE.md) in the
project files.

## Status

This is experimental software initially developed for my specific needs and
those of other laboratory members. It has not been extensively tested. Use at
your own risks!

## Installation

This package was developed for Python 3.6 and will not work with Python 2. Link
the `src` directory or copy its content to a location where it will be found by
your Python interpreter. If the `progressbar` package is available, it will be
used to monitor the progress of some algorithms.

## Documentation

There is no documentation for this package. A short tutorial about editing
Gromacs topologies is available on the TheoChem@RUB wiki (restricted to
in-campus access):

Refer to the source code and the `examples` directory for more details.

## Community

Dorothy is developed by [Olivier Fisette](mailto:olivier.fisette@rub.de) in the
[Molecular Simulation Group](https://molecular-simulation.org/) of Lars V.
Schäfer at the Center for Theoretical Chemistry of Ruhr-University Bochum,
Germany.

Contributions, bug reports and feature suggestions are welcome. Development is
tracked in the project’s [repository](https://github.com/ofisette/mdjoy).
